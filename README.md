# igg-client
A desktop client for the IGG-Games website.


So far with this client you can resolve all bluemediafiles links, scrape magnet links from IGG/PCGamesTorrents URLs, and search for games on IGG.

Please note that this project is not publicly released as of now.

Note: you might notice that some of these images are from different vesions, I apologise for the confusion. I have been working nonstop on this project for a few days and I do not have time to change this up too much. Readme will be fixed by the time v1.0 rolls around.
