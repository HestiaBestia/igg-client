# igg-client
A desktop client for the IGG-Games website.


So far with this client, you can resolve all bluemediafiles links and you can scrape magnet links from IGG/PCGamesTorrents URLs.
Please note that this project is not near public release. The first public release will be when the promise of not havign to use the website is fulfilled.

Note: you might notice that some of these images are from different vesions, I apologise for the confusion. I have been working nonstop on this project for a few days and I do not have time to change this up too much. Readme will be fixed by the time v1.0 rolls around.
